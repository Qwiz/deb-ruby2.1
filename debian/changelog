ruby2.0 (2.0.0.299-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    + Includes a fix for override of existing LDFLAGS when building compiled
      extensions that use pkg-config (Closes: #721799).
  * debian/rules: forward-port to tcl/tk packages with multi-arch support.
    Thanks to Tristan Hill for reporting on build for Ubuntu saucy
  * debian/control: ruby2.0 now provides ruby-interpreter
  * Now using tarballs generated from the git mirror.
    + The released tarballs will modify shipped files on clean. Without this
      we can stop messing around with files that need to be recovered after a
      `debian/rules clean` to make them match the orig tarball and avoid
      spurious diffs.
    + This also lets us drop the diffs against generated files such as
      tool/config.* and configure.
    + documented in debian/README.source
  * debian/libruby2.0.symbols: refreshed with 2 new symbols added since last
    version.
